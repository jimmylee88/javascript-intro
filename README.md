## About
Using our knowledge from our introduction to Javascript, we're tasked with creating a To-do list application.
The requirements are that the user is able to:
* Add a new task to a list
* Display all tasks
* Error handling, so empty tasks can't be added
* Ability to delete tasks

## Approach 1.
I'm still trying to get head around Javascript but struggling with it.
I know what things do, but the syntax is completely alien and has really thrown me off.
To begin with, I followed a YouTube tutorial and ended up creating this along with it:

https://jimmylee88.github.io/javascript-intro/To-do-list/index.html

It answers the requirements of the task, and I know why things work, but I'm not 100% sure how. I don't think I would be able to create it without the video as a reference again.
I was able to apply previous learning about CSS and HTML, but that isn't the purpose of this Javascript task.
So I'll have another go, and try to create something myself from scratch and not think too much about the styling.

## Approach 2
My biggest problem with the tutorial method is that it doesn't use semantic input tags (radio button, or checkboxes) or buttons for checking off items or removing them.
This means that when a keyboard-only user, or someone using a screen reader tabs through the structure of the page, the box for ticking off a list item is missed. That's because the tutorial simply uses list items with styling to *look* like checkboxes but they aren't structured like that semantically.

I think what I'll do is re-do the task and make sure every element uses semantic html tags, and do the javascript from scratch even if the results aren't as aesthetically pleasing.
